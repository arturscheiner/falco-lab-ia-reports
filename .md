I'm happy to help you with your Falco alert. However, I don't see an attachment attached to your message. Could you please share the content of the attachment (e.g., log file or alert output) so I can review it and provide a report on my findings?

Once I receive the attachment, I'll create a detailed report in Markdown format that includes:

1. An analysis of the behavior observed in the alert.
2. Potential mitigation strategies to deal with the issue.
3. Possible command-line options or configuration changes that can be applied to address the problem.

Please share the attachment, and I'll get started on creating the report!
