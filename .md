I'm happy to help you with your Falco alert, but I don't see an attached file. Can you please paste the content of the alert attachment here?

Once I have access to the content, I'll create a report explaining what's happening and provide suggestions for mitigating the behavior.

If you're comfortable sharing, you can also describe the type of activity that's triggering the alert (e.g., unusual login attempts, suspicious network traffic) and any relevant context or logs. This will help me provide more targeted recommendations.

Please paste the attachment content, and I'll get started on creating your report!
