I'm happy to help you with your Falco alert report!

However, I don't see an attachment provided in our conversation. Could you please share the contents of the attachment (e.g., Falco alert log) with me?

Once I have access to the content, I'll provide a detailed report on what's being seen, along with suggestions on how to mitigate the behavior and potential command line or configuration changes that can be applied.

Please paste the attachment contents, and I'll get started on creating your report in Markdown format.
