I'm happy to help you with your Falco alert report! However, I don't see an attachment in your message. Could you please share the contents of the attachment (e.g., a log file or a JSON output) that generated the alert?

Once I receive the attachment, I'll generate a report explaining what I'm seeing and providing suggestions on how to mitigate the behavior. The report will be formatted in Markdown.

Please paste the contents of the attachment, and I'll get started!
