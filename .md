I'm happy to help you with your Falco alert! However, I don't see an attachment attached to your message. Could you please share the content of the attachment (e.g., a log file or a JSON object) so I can analyze it and provide you with a detailed report?

Once I receive the attachment, I'll generate a Markdown-formatted report that explains what I'm seeing, provides suggestions on how to mitigate the behavior, and offers possible command-line or configuration changes to address the issue.

Please share the attachment, and I'll get started!
