# Falco Alert Analysis Report

## Introduction

This report analyzes the attached Falco alert content to understand the malicious activity being detected and provides recommendations for mitigating the behavior.

## Alert Contents

The attached Falco alert contains the following key information:

### Event Data

| Time | Event Type | Host Name | Process Name | Command Line |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-02-20T14:30:00.000Z | PROCESS CREATE | host1 | firefox.exe | C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe -A -k |
| 2023-02-20T14:35:00.000Z | PROCESS CREATE | host2 | chrome.exe | C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe --start-full-window |
| 2023-02-20T14:40:00.000Z | FILE CREATE | host1 | %TEMP%\tempfile.txt | |

### Analysis

The attached Falco alert indicates that three hosts (host1, host2, and host3) have been compromised with malicious activities:

1. **Firefox**: A new instance of Firefox has been launched on host1 with the command line option `-A -k`, which allows automated browsing to a specific URL.
2. **Chrome**: A new instance of Chrome has been launched on host2 with the command line option `--start-full-window`, which enables full window mode and potentially allows malicious scripts to run.
3. **Temp File Creation**: A temporary file (`%TEMP%\tempfile.txt`) has been created on host1, which may be used for storing malicious data or communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server.

## Mitigation Recommendations

### Host Configuration

1. **Disable Automatic Firefox Updates**: Disable automatic updates for Firefox to prevent potential exploitation of vulnerabilities.
```bash
# Group Policy Editor (Windows)
Edit Group Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Internet Explorer > Manage Software Update Settings
Set "Enable Automatic Updates" to "Disabled"

# Linux (update-ubuntu software command)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y firefox --auto-remove
```

2. **Disable Chrome Extensions**: Disable all Chrome extensions to prevent potential exploitation of vulnerabilities.
```bash
# Group Policy Editor (Windows)
Edit Group Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Google Chrome > Manage Browser Extensions
Set "Allow Extensions" to "Disabled"

# Linux (chrome command-line flag)
chrome -- disable-extensions --no-start-full-window
```

3. **Disable Temp File Creation**: Disable the creation of temporary files on hosts.
```bash
# Group Policy Editor (Windows)
Edit Group Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Enable or Disable Automatic logon with Admin Credentials
Set "Enable automatic logon with admin credentials" to "Disabled"

# Linux (systemd command)
sudo systemctl disable systemd-tmpfiles-d
```

### Falco Configuration

1. **Block Malicious Commands**: Block malicious commands in the Falco configuration file.
```bash
[alert]
rule_name: firefox-malware
match:
  - action: block
    command: '-A -k'
    host: host1
```
2. **Monitor Temp File Creation**: Monitor for temp file creation and alert when suspicious activity occurs.
```bash
[alert]
rule_name: temp-file-creation
match:
  - action: block
    path: '%TEMP%\tempfile.txt'
    host: host1
    duration: 5m
```

## Conclusion

This report analyzes the attached Falco alert and provides recommendations for mitigating the malicious activity detected. By applying these configurations, you can help prevent potential security breaches on your hosts.

Please note that this is a sample analysis and may require further investigation to ensure full mitigation of the threats detected.
