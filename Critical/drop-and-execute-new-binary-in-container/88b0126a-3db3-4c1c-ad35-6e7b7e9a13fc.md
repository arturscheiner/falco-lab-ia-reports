# Falco Alert Report
=====================================

## Overview
-----------

This report summarizes the alert generated by Falco regarding a potential security vulnerability. The alert indicates that a new binary is being executed in a container, which may be an indicator of a malicious activity.

## Alert Details
-----------------

### UUID
--------

* `uuid`: `88b0126a-3db3-4c1c-ad35-6e7b7e9a13fc`

### Output
------------

```
14:00:57.770533199: Critical Executing binary not part of base image (proc_exe=/bin/falco-event-generator-syscall-DropAndExecuteNewBinaryInContainer-gJBz5n proc_sname=event-generator gparent=containerd-shim proc_exe_ino_ctime=1728133257764054081 proc_exe_ino_mtime=1728133257764054081 proc_exe_ino_ctime_duration_proc_start=6211156 proc_cwd=/ container_start_ts=1728133229850062067 evt_type=execve user=root user_uid=0 user_loginuid=-1 process=falco-event-gen proc_exepath=/bin/falco-event-generator-syscall-DropAndExecuteNewBinaryInContainer-gJBz5n parent=event-generator command=falco-event-gen terminal=34816 exe_flags=EXE_WRITABLE|EXE_UPPER_LAYER container_id=c61b4b13ae44 container_name=peaceful_mestorf)
```

### Priority
------------

* `priority`: Critical

### Rule
-------

* `rule`: "Drop and execute new binary in container"

### Time
-----

* `time`: 2024-10-05T13:00:57.770533199Z

### Output Fields
-----------------

Refer to the attached output fields for a detailed description of each field.

## Analysis
------------

The alert indicates that a new binary is being executed in a container, which may be an indicator of a malicious activity. The `proc_exe` field points to a new binary `/bin/falco-event-generator-syscall-DropAndExecuteNewBinaryInContainer-gJBz5n` being executed, while the `gparent` field indicates that the process is running in the container `containerd-shim`. This suggests that the new binary may be a custom-built binary that is not part of the base image.

## Mitigation Strategies
-----------------------

### 1. Investigate the Source Code

* Review the source code of the `/bin/falco-event-generator-syscall-DropAndExecuteNewBinaryInContainer-gJBz5n` binary to determine its purpose and origin.
* Check for any suspicious or unexpected code modifications.

### 2. Verify Container Configuration

* Inspect the container configuration to ensure that it is not being used to execute malicious binaries.
* Check for any unexpected changes to the container's `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` files.

### 3. Implement Additional Logging and Monitoring

* Configure additional logging and monitoring tools to track container activity and detect suspicious behavior.
* Consider implementing a network traffic analysis tool to monitor container communication.

### 4. Update Falco Configuration

* Review and update the Falco configuration to exclude the `/bin/falco-event-generator-syscall-DropAndExecuteNewBinaryInContainer-gJBz5n` binary from being detected as suspicious activity.
* Consider adding additional rules to detect and alert on similar container activity.

### 5. Perform Regular Security Audits

* Schedule regular security audits to review container configurations, Dockerfile modifications, and other potential vulnerabilities.
* Ensure that the audit process includes reviewing logs and monitoring system activity for suspicious behavior.

Example Falco configuration updates:

```yml
rules:
  - name: drop-and-execute-new-binary-in-container
    condition:
      or:
        - type: execve
          container_id: c61b4b13ae44
          proc.exe_path: /bin/falco-event-generator-syscall-DropAndExecuteNewBinaryInContainer-gJBz5n
        - type: execve
          container_id: c61b4b13ae44
          proc.exe_ino_ctime_duration_proc_start: 6211156
    output:
      - alert.new-binary-executed-in-container
```

```yml
output:
  alert.new-binary-executed-in-container:
    title: New binary executed in container
    description: A new binary was executed in a container.
    severity: critical
```
These are just some potential mitigation strategies and example Falco configuration updates. Please note that the specific actions required will depend on the context of your environment and the results of your investigation.
