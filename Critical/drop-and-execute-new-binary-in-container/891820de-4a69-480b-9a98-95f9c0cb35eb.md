# Falco Alert Report
=====================================

### Summary

This alert report indicates a potential security vulnerability related to the execution of new binaries in containers. The alert is triggered by a process (`falco-event-gen`) that is not part of the base image and has write access to the container.

### Detailed Analysis

The alert details are as follows:

*   **Event Type:** `execve`
*   **Process Name:** `containerd-shim`
*   **Command Line:** `falco-event-generator-syscall-DropAndExecuteNewBinaryInContainer-uO78Qg`
*   **User and UID:** `root` (UID: 0)
*   **Container ID and Name:** `69484342a56c` (`modest_brahmagupta`)
*   **File System Information:** The process has write access to the container (`proc.exe_ino.ctime_duration_proc_start=5289288`, indicating a long-running process)

### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Review and Restrict Container Privileges

Verify that the `containerd-shim` process is not necessary for the functioning of the container. If it's not required, remove it from the container or restrict its privileges using `docker run` options.

Example:
```bash
docker run -it --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock modest_brahmagupta
```
By removing the `-p` flag, we limit the container's network capabilities and prevent unnecessary privilege escalation.

#### 2. Monitor Container Activity

Implement monitoring tools to detect similar events in the future. This can be achieved using Falco's `container` rule with added filtering conditions to reduce noise.

Example (add this to your Falco configuration file):
```yml
rules:
- name: containerMonitoring
  description: Monitor container activity
  source: container
  tags: ['maturity_stable', 'mitre_persistence']
  condition:
    and:
      - container.start_ts < now(1h)
```
This rule will monitor containers with a start time within the last hour, reducing unnecessary alerts.

#### 3. Implement Binary Signature Checks

Integrate a binary signature check mechanism to ensure only trusted binaries are executed in containers.

Example (using `AppArmor` or similar):
```bash
docker run -it --apparmor-profile=non-executable-modest_brahmagupta modest_brahmagupta
```
This profile restricts the execution of non-trusted binary files, reducing the risk of malicious code injection.

### Conclusion

The alert indicates a potential security vulnerability in the container's activity. By reviewing and restricting container privileges, monitoring container activity, and implementing binary signature checks, you can mitigate this issue and improve the overall security posture of your containers.

**Additional Recommendations:**

*   Regularly review Falco alert logs to identify patterns or anomalies.
*   Implement additional monitoring tools to detect similar events in the future.
*   Consider integrating a vulnerability scanner to assess container images for potential security vulnerabilities.
