**Report: Fileless Execution via memfd_create**

**Summary**

Falco has detected a critical alert indicating fileless execution via `memfd_create` on the host `mini-debian-lab`. This behavior is associated with an unknown process (`containerd-shim`) executing a malicious command (`3 run helper.DoNothing`) in memory, which could potentially be used for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

**Analysis**

The alert indicates that the process `containerd-shim` has executed a fileless command via `memfd_create`, which creates a new memory mapping without writing to disk. This technique is often used by attackers to evade detection by traditional security controls. The malicious command is likely a helper function designed to facilitate further malicious activity.

**Possible Impact**

This behavior could be indicative of an attack attempt aimed at establishing persistence on the host or exfiltrating sensitive data. If left unchecked, this could lead to compromised access to system resources and potentially result in data breaches or other security incidents.

**Mitigation Strategies**

### 1. Block unknown processes

To prevent the execution of unknown processes, Falco can be configured to block suspicious processes. This can be achieved by adding a `falco.yml` configuration file with the following content:
```yml
- rule: block_unknown_process
  name: Block unknown process
  priority: INFO
  action: block
  condition:
    - container.name != "modest_brahmagupta"
```
### 2. Limit memory mapping permissions

To restrict the creation of new memory mappings, Falco can be configured to limit the `mmap` and `mremap` system calls on the host. This can be achieved by adding a `falco.yml` configuration file with the following content:
```yml
- rule: limit_memory_mapping
  name: Limit memory mapping permissions
  priority: INFO
  action: deny
  condition:
    - evt.type == "mmap"
```
### 3. Implement additional logging and monitoring

To improve incident response and detection, Falco can be configured to log more detailed information about suspicious activity. This can include increasing the log level for the `syscall` source to `DEBUG`, adding more tags to the alert, or configuring additional metrics collection.

**Example `falco.yml` Configuration**
```yml
- rule: block_unknown_process
  name: Block unknown process
  priority: INFO
  action: block
  condition:
    - container.name != "modest_brahmagupta"

- rule: limit_memory_mapping
  name: Limit memory mapping permissions
  priority: INFO
  action: deny
  condition:
    - evt.type == "mmap"

- rule: increase_syslog_logging
  name: Increase syslog logging
  priority: INFO
  action: enable
  condition:
    - source == "syscall"
    - log_level >= "DEBUG"

- rule: add_additional_tags
  name: Add additional tags
  priority: INFO
  action: set
  condition:
    - evt.tags != ["T1620", "container", "host"]
```
**Conclusion**

This report highlights the importance of monitoring and detecting suspicious activity on hosts using Falco. By implementing the suggested mitigation strategies, organizations can improve their security posture and reduce the risk of fileless execution via `memfd_create`. Regularly reviewing and updating Falco configurations, as well as increasing incident response capabilities, are essential to staying ahead of emerging threats.
