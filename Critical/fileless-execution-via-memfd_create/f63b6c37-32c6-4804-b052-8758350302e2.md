**Incident Report: Fileless Execution via memfd_create**

**Summary**
----------

Falco has detected a critical incident involving fileless execution via `memfd_create` on the system. This indicates that an attacker has exploited a vulnerability to execute malicious code without creating any files on disk.

**Details**

The attached alert message provides detailed information about the incident:

*   **Timestamp**: 2024-10-05T18:26:50.339057119Z
*   **Priority**: Critical

    *   User UID: 0

**Analysis**

The `memfd_create` system call is used to create a new anonymous file descriptor, which can be used for fileless execution. In this incident, the attacker has exploited this vulnerability to execute malicious code without creating any files on disk.

**Possible Impact**

This incident could have significant consequences if left unaddressed. The attacker may use this vulnerability to:

*   Steal sensitive data
*   Conduct lateral movement within the system
*   Create new credentials

**Mitigation Strategies**

To mitigate this behavior, consider implementing the following measures:

### 1. Enforce Least Privilege Principle

Ensure that containers and processes run with minimal privileges to reduce the attack surface.

```bash
# Update container image to use a more secure base image
docker build -t romantic_jemison:latest -f Dockerfile --build-arg=SECURITY_LEVEL=high .

# Configure container to run with reduced privileges
sudo docker run -it --rm --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -v /tmp:/tmp romantic_jemison:latest
```

### 2. Monitor for Suspicious Activity

Implement Falco or similar monitoring tools to detect and alert on suspicious activity.

```bash
# Update falco configuration file (falco.conf)
[rule "Fileless Execution via memfd_create"]
    # Define the rule
    match:
      - process: containerd-shim
        args: ['run', 'helper.DoNothing']
        flags: EXE_WRITABLE|EXE_FROM_MEMFD
    priority: 10

# Start falco monitoring service
sudo systemctl start falco
```

### 3. Implement Memory Protection

Use memory protection mechanisms, such as ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) and DEP (Data Execution Prevention), to make it harder for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Enable ASLR for containerd-shim process
sudo echo "ASLR=on" >> /etc/docker/daemon.json

# Enable DEP for containerd-shim process
sudo echo "DEP=on" >> /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

### 4. Regularly Update and Patch Systems

Keep systems, containers, and applications up to date with the latest security patches.

```bash
# Check for updates and apply them
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```

**Conclusion**

Fileless execution via `memfd_create` is a critical vulnerability that can be exploited by attackers to conduct malicious activities. Implementing mitigation strategies, such as enforcing least privilege principle, monitoring for suspicious activity, implementing memory protection, and regularly updating systems, can help reduce the risk of successful attacks.
