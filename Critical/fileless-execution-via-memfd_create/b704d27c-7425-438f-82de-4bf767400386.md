**Fileless Execution Alert Report**
=====================================

**Summary**

A critical alert has been generated by Falco, indicating a potential security threat on the host `mini-debian-lab`. The alert suggests that a fileless execution via `memfd_create` was detected in a container named `modest_brahmagupta`.

**Alert Details**
-----------------

The alert is classified as Critical and was triggered at 2024-10-05T18:29:49.874985891Z.

### Alert Output

```markdown
19:29:49.874985891: Critical Fileless execution via memfd_create (container_start_ts=1728152978598805986 proc_cwd=/ evt_res=SUCCESS proc_sname=event-generator gparent=containerd-shim evt_type=execve user=root user_uid=0 user_loginuid=-1 process=3 proc_exepath=memfd:program parent=event-generator command=3 run helper.DoNothing terminal=34816 exe_flags=EXE_WRITABLE|EXE_FROM_MEMFD container_id=69484342a56c container_name=modest_brahmagupta)
```

### Alert Fields

The alert includes the following fields:

* `container.id`: `69484342a56c`
* `container.name`: `modest_brahmagupta`
* `proc.aname[2]`: `containerd-shim`
* `proc.cmdline`: `3 run helper.DoNothing`
* `proc.cwd`: `/`
* `proc.exepath`: `memfd:program`
* `proc.name`: `3`
* `proc.pname`: `event-generator`
* `proc.sname`: `event-generator`
* `proc.tty`: 34816
* `user.loginuid`: -1
* `user.name`: `root`
* `user.uid`: 0

### Possible Threats

Fileless execution via `memfd_create` can be used to evade detection by traditional malware analysis tools. This technique allows the creation of a memory-based executable without writing it to disk, making it harder to detect.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate this threat, consider the following configuration changes and command-line options:

#### 1. Enable Filesystem Monitoring

*   Update Falco's configuration to include filesystem monitoring:
    ```markdown
rule: fs.inode_create
source: syscall
tags: ["T1620", "container"]
```
    This will help detect any suspicious file creations or modifications.

#### 2. Block Memfd Create System Calls

*   Use `seccomp` to block the `memfd_create` system call:
    ```bash
echo "-D memfd_create" >> /etc/seccomp/rules.d/default.conf
```
    This will prevent the use of `memfd_create` in user space.

#### 3. Enforce Strict Filesystem Access

*   Configure Falco to enforce strict filesystem access:
    ```markdown
rule: fs.access
source: syscall
tags: ["T1620", "container"]
```
    This will help detect any suspicious file access attempts.

### Conclusion

Fileless execution via `memfd_create` is a potential security threat that can be mitigated by implementing the above configuration changes and command-line options. Regularly reviewing Falco alerts and adjusting configurations as needed will help prevent similar threats from occurring in the future.

**Recommendations**

1.  Review and update Falco's configuration to include filesystem monitoring, block memfd create system calls, and enforce strict filesystem access.
2.  Test these changes on a non-production environment before applying them to production systems.
3.  Regularly review Falco alerts for potential security threats and adjust configurations as needed.
