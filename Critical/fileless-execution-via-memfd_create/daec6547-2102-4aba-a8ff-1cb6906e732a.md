# Incident Report
## Summary

The attached Falco alert indicates a critical incident of fileless execution via `memfd_create` on the host `mini-debian-lab`. This behavior is associated with a container named `pedantic_varahamihira` that is running a suspicious command (`3 run helper.DoNothing`) as the root user.

## Detailed Analysis

The alert provides detailed information about the incident, including:

*   **Container ID and Name**: The container ID is `dca990c78804`, and its name is `pedantic_varahamihira`.
*   **Event Details**: The event details indicate that the fileless execution occurred on a container start, with the command `memfd:program` being executed as part of the container's execution. This suggests that the container has attempted to execute code without loading it from disk, potentially using memory-mapped files (memfds) for this purpose.
*   **User and Process Information**: The user associated with this incident is `root`, which has a high privilege level on the system. The process ID (`proc.name`) is also interesting as it suggests that the suspicious command (`3 run helper.DoNothing`) is being executed by the container's process.

## Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following steps:

### 1. Containerization Best Practices

*   Implement strict security policies for containers, ensuring they follow the principle of least privilege.
*   Regularly update and patch containers to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

    ```bash
# Enable strict security policies for containers
docker run --security-opt seccomp=unconfined -it image_name

# Update and patch containers regularly
docker pull container_image_name:latest
```

### 2. Filesystem Monitoring

*   Set up filesystem monitoring to detect suspicious activity, such as the creation of new memfds or unusual writes.
    ```bash
# Enable filesystem monitoring with FSTICKER and FILEMON
fstricker --mount /proc/memfd filemon --mount /dev/pts -t -- --log-file /var/log/filemon.log
```

### 3. Root Privileges Management

*   Implement strict root privileges management to prevent excessive abuse.
    ```bash
# Set maximum allowed shell sessions for the root user
sudo echo 1 > /root/max_sessions
```
*   Limit root user access to essential services and applications only.

### 4. Regular Security Audits

Regular security audits can help identify potential vulnerabilities in your system, containerization setup, or applications.

## Conclusion

This incident highlights the importance of implementing robust security measures to prevent fileless execution attacks on your hosts. By following best practices for containerization, monitoring suspicious activity, managing root privileges, and conducting regular security audits, you can mitigate such incidents and protect your systems against emerging threats.

Please note that these suggestions are just a starting point, and specific configurations may vary based on your system's architecture, applications, and requirements.
