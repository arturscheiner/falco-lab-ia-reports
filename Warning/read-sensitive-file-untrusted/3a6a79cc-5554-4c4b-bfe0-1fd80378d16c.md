**Incident Report**
=================

### Summary

A suspicious activity has been detected on the host `k8s-worker-01`. The incident involves a non-trusted program attempting to open and read a sensitive file, `/etc/shadow`, which is typically not accessible by user `root` or other non-root users.

### Detailed Analysis

The Falco alert indicates that the incident occurred at 14:58:16.254721074 UTC on October 29, 2024. The details of the incident are as follows:

* **Event Type:** openat
* **File Descriptor (FD):** /etc/shadow
* **Program Executable Path:** /bin/cat
* **Parent Process:** containerd-shim
* **Terminal Number:** 34816

The file `/etc/shadow` contains sensitive information about system users and groups, making it a critical target for unauthorized access.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following command-line and configuration modifications:

1.  **Implement Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**

    *   Install `selinux` or `apparmor` depending on your Linux distribution.
    *   Configure MAC policies to restrict access to sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`.
    *   Use `setroubleshoot` or `audit2allow` tools to help with policy configuration.

        Example (SELinux):
        ```bash
# Set the context for /etc/shadow to restrict access
sudo chgrp nobody /etc/shadow
sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

# Create a new SELinux policy module
sudo cat > /etc/selinux/limits.d/shadow.te <<EOF
allow { any } file { /etc/shadow } read;

# EOF
sudo checkmodule -M -m -o /usr/lib/selinux/shadow.te
sudo semodule -i /usr/lib/selinux/shadow.te
```

2.  **Restrict Root Privileges**

    *   Limit root privileges by configuring a restrictive shell or adding `no_new_privs` to `/etc security/limits.conf`.
    *   Use tools like `sudo` with `-n` option to limit the number of privileged commands.

        Example:
        ```bash
# Set no_new_privs for root user
sudo usermod -aG nobody,root

# Limit sudo privileges
sudo visudo <<EOF
# Allow only specific users to use sudo
sudo   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cat
EOF
```

3.  **Supervise and Monitor Containerd-Shim**

    *   Ensure containerd-shim is running with a proper security context.
    *   Use Falco's `container` event to monitor and alert on suspicious container behavior.

        Example:
        ```bash
# Define a new rule in Falco configuration ( falco.conf )
rule "Suspicious Container Behavior"
  when:
    type: container
    container.id == "<container_id>"
  then:
    tag: T1555
    description: "Suspicious container behavior detected"
```

### Next Steps

*   Review and adjust the security context of `containerd-shim` to prevent similar incidents.
*   Continuously monitor and analyze Falco logs for potential security incidents.

**Conclusion**

The incident highlights the importance of monitoring system activity and implementing robust security measures. By understanding the root cause and applying the mitigation strategies outlined in this report, you can reduce the risk of future security incidents on your hosts.
