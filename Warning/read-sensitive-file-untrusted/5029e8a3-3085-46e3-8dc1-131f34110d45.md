# Alert Analysis Report
========================

### Overview

This report analyzes an alert generated by Falco regarding a suspicious activity on the host `k8s-worker-01`. The alert indicates that a non-trusted program has opened a sensitive file `/etc/shadow` for reading.

### Alert Details

The attached JSON attachment contains the following details:

*   **uuid**: `5029e8a3-3085-46e3-8dc1-131f34110d45`
*   **output**: The Falco output containing information about the event, including process details and container metadata.
*   **priority**: `Warning`, indicating that the alert is a potential security concern but not critical.
*   **rule**: "Read sensitive file untrusted"
*   **time**: `2024-10-29T14:09:50.596389119Z`

### Analysis

The Falco alert indicates that the `cat` process, running with user ID 0 (root) and login UID -1, has opened the `/etc/shadow` file for reading. This is a sensitive file containing password information, which should not be accessible to non-trusted programs.

The presence of a non-trusted program accessing a sensitive file raises concerns about potential security risks. It may indicate an escalation of privileges or a malicious activity.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following steps:

#### 1. Review and Update Configuration

*   Check the Falco configuration to ensure it is set up correctly and aligned with your organization's security policies.
*   Verify that the `k8s-worker-01` host is not mistakenly flagged as a non-trusted system.

#### 2. Enhance Access Control

*   Ensure that access to sensitive files, such as `/etc/shadow`, is restricted to authorized programs only.
*   Implement strict access control mechanisms using Linux permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 /etc/shadow`).

#### 3. Monitor and Audit Logs

*   Set up logging and monitoring to track suspicious activity on the host, including access to sensitive files.
*   Regularly review logs to identify potential security incidents.

#### 4. Limit Privileges of Non-Trusted Programs

*   Configure Linux permissions to limit privileges for non-trusted programs (e.g., `chown -R user:group /etc/shadow`).
*   Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).

#### 5. Conduct Regular Security Audits

*   Perform regular security audits to identify potential vulnerabilities and address them before they can be exploited.
*   Update dependencies, plugins, and configurations as needed.

### Example Configuration Changes

To mitigate this behavior, consider applying the following configuration changes:

**Falco Configuration**

Add the following rule to your Falco configuration:
```yaml
rules:
  - name: Read sensitive file untrusted
    condition:
      or:
        - type == 'openat' and fd.name in ['/etc/shadow', '/etc/passwd']
        - type == 'read' and fd.name in ['/etc/shadow', '/etc/passwd']
    action:
      log: info
```
**Linux Permissions**

Update the permissions of `/etc/shadow` to restrict access:
```bash
chmod 600 /etc/shadow
```

By applying these mitigation strategies, you can reduce the risk associated with non-trusted programs accessing sensitive files and protect your hosts from potential security incidents.
