**Alert Analysis Report**

**Summary:**
The attached Falco alert indicates a potential security vulnerability where a non-trusted program (i.e., `cat`) is attempting to read sensitive files (`/etc/shadow`) on the host machine. The alert provides detailed information about the event, including the container ID, image repository and tag, and process details.

**Event Analysis:**

* **Event Type:** `openat`
* **File Descriptors:** `/etc/shadow` (FD #13)
* **Process Details:**
	+ Process Name: `cat`
	+ Command Line: `cat /etc/shadow`
	+ Exe Path: `/bin/cat`
	+ Parent PID: `containerd-shim` (ID: `proc.pname`)
	+ Container ID: `d2d430b34bdd`
* **User Information:**
	+ User Name: `root`
	+ Login UID: 0
	+ Login UID for process: -1

**Mitigation and Recommendations:**

### Configuration Adjustments:

1. **Set file permissions:** Ensure that sensitive files like `/etc/shadow` have restricted permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 /etc/shadow`).
2. **Disable unnecessary programs:** Verify that the `cat` program is not necessary for the container's operation and consider removing it or configuring it to run with limited access.
3. **Container configuration:** Review the container image repository and tag to ensure they are secure and do not contain any sensitive files.

### Falco Configuration:

1. **Update the rule:**
```yaml
rules:
  - name: Read sensitive file untrusted
    mode: log
    severity: WARNING
    expr: event.type == "openat" and container.image.repository == "docker.io/library/busybox"
    tags: ["T1555", "container", "filesystem", "host"]
```
This updated rule will trigger only when the `docker.io/library/busybox` image is used, ensuring that the alert is not triggered by unnecessary containers.

2. **Add an additional condition to filter out legitimate access:** You can add a condition to filter out events where the file descriptor being accessed is owned by the root user:
```yaml
rules:
  - name: Read sensitive file untrusted
    mode: log
    severity: WARNING
    expr: event.type == "openat" and container.image.repository == "docker.io/library/busybox"
      AND (fd.name not in ["/etc/shadow"]) or (user.loginuid != 0)
    tags: ["T1555", "container", "filesystem", "host"]
```
This updated rule will filter out events where the `/etc/shadow` file is accessed, ensuring that only sensitive file access by non-root users is detected.

**Additional Recommendations:**

1. **Regularly review and update container images:** Ensure that container images are regularly reviewed and updated to prevent vulnerabilities.
2. **Implement additional security measures:** Consider implementing additional security measures such as SELinux or AppArmor to restrict file system access.
3. **Monitor and analyze logs:** Continuously monitor and analyze log data to detect potential security incidents.

By implementing these recommendations, you can help mitigate the risk of sensitive files being accessed by non-trusted programs and ensure a more secure environment for your hosts.
