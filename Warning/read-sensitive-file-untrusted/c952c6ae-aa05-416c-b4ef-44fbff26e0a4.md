# Alert Analysis Report
=====================================

### Summary

The attached Falco alert indicates that a non-trusted program has opened a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`) for reading. The file is owned by the `root` user and has a UID of 0, suggesting it's the system's password file.

### Detailed Analysis

| **Field** | **Value** |
| --- | --- |
| `evt_type`: | openat |
| `fd.name`: | `/etc/shadow` |
| `proc.exepath`: | `/bin/cat` |
| `user.name`: | `root` |
| `user.uid`: | 0 |

The Falco alert suggests that the behavior is related to T1555, which is a MITRE ATT&CK technique. This technique involves exploiting or leveraging sensitive information from local files.

### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Implement File Permissions

To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files:

*   Set file permissions to restrict read and write access for non-root users.
    ```bash
sudo chown -R root:root /etc/shadow
sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
```
    This sets the file ownership to `root` and changes the permissions to restrict read and write access (`600`).

#### 2. Monitor File Access

To detect suspicious file access:

*   Set up a Falco rule to monitor file opens with sensitive files.
    ```yml
rules:
  - name: Read sensitive file untrusted
    desc: Detects when a non-trusted program opens a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/shadow`).
    pattern: (fd.name == '/etc/shadow' and proc.aname[0] != 'root')
    filters:
      - syscall: openat
```
    This rule detects file opens with the `/etc/shadow` file when non-root users attempt to access it.

#### 3. Configure Systemd

To restrict access to sensitive files:

*   Create a `systemd.service` file that defines the allowed capabilities for the container:
    ```bash
[Unit]
Description=Restricted Container
CapabilityDrop=[chown, setcap]
```
    This ensures that only specific capabilities are dropped from the container.

#### 4. Log and Analyze

To track suspicious activity:

*   Set up a logging system to collect and analyze Falco alerts.
*   Implement a SIEM solution to correlate log data with the Falco alert.

### Conclusion

The attached Falco alert highlights a potential security vulnerability related to sensitive file access. By implementing file permissions, monitoring file access, configuring systemd, and logging/sanalyzing suspicious activity, you can mitigate this behavior and protect your system from unauthorized access.
