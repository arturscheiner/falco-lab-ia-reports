**Alert Analysis Report**
=========================

**Summary**

The attached Falco alert indicates that a non-trusted program (identified as `event-generator`) has opened the `/etc/shadow` file for reading, which is a sensitive file. The event occurred on a host named `mini-debian-lab`, and the program is running in a container with ID `c61b4b13ae44`.

**Details**

*   **Event Type**: `openat`
*   **File Path**: `/etc/shadow`
*   **Process Information**:
    *   `proc.aname[2]`: `systemd` (process name)
    *   `proc.exepath`: `/bin/event-generator` (executable path)
    *   `proc.cmdline`: `event-generator run syscall --loop` (command line arguments)
*   **User Information**:
    *   `user.name`: `root`
    *   `user.uid`: 0
    *   `user.loginuid`: -1

**Mitigation and Configuration**

To mitigate this behavior, the following steps can be taken:

### 1. Review Container Configuration

Ensure that container configurations do not allow non-trusted programs to access sensitive files.

*   Verify that the `event-generator` command is properly authorized and has only necessary permissions.
*   Review the container configuration (e.g., using Docker Compose or Kubernetes) to ensure that sensitive files are not exposed unnecessarily.

### 2. File Permissions

Adjust file permissions on `/etc/shadow` to limit access:

```bash
sudo chgrp root /etc/shadow
sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
```

These commands will set the group owner of `/etc/shadow` to `root`, and the permissions (owner, group, and other) to `600`, which restricts access to only the owner (`root`) and prevents any group or other users from reading or writing to the file.

### 3. Falco Configuration

Configure Falco to detect this event:

```yml
rules:
  - name: Read sensitive file untrusted
    filter:
      fields:
        evt.type: openat
        fd.name: /etc/shadow
        proc.aname[2]: systemd
    trigger:
      level: WARNING
```

This configuration will alert on events where `openat` occurs, and the target file path is `/etc/shadow`, with a trusted process name of `systemd`.

### 4. System Monitoring

Regularly monitor system logs to detect similar events:

*   Enable logging for the `event-generator` command: `sudojournalctl -u event-generator`
*   Set up log rotation and monitoring tools (e.g., `logrotate`, `logwatch`) to track changes in sensitive file access.

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the risk of non-trusted programs accessing sensitive files on your hosts.
