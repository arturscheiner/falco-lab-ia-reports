# Alert Analysis Report
=====================================

## Overview

An alert has been generated by Falco, indicating that a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`) was opened for reading by a non-trusted program (`cat`). This report provides an analysis of the incident and suggestions for mitigation.

## Incident Details

*   **Event**: Openat (open a file) event with file `/etc/shadow` and process `cat`.
*   **Process Information**:
    *   Process name: `cat`
    *   Parent process: `runc`
    *   Grandparent process: `systemd`
*   **Container Information**:
    *   Container ID: `711236931bc7`
    *   Container image repository: `docker.io/library/busybox`
    *   Container image tag: `latest`
    *   Container name: `busybox`

## Analysis

The incident indicates that a non-trusted program (`cat`) has accessed a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`). This is a potential security risk, as `/etc/shadow` contains sensitive information such as user passwords.

## Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Restrict Access to Sensitive Files

*   **Filesystem permissions**: Set the file permissions of `/etc/shadow` to restrict access to trusted users only.
    ```bash
sudo chown root:root /etc/shadow
sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
```
*   ** SELinux policies**: Configure SELinux policies to restrict access to sensitive files.

### 2. Monitor and Audit File Access

*   **Falco configuration**: Update Falco's `filter.json` file to include additional rules for monitoring file access.
    ```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "name": "File Access",
      "type": "FS",
      "actions": ["syslog"]
    }
  ]
}
```
*   **Log analysis tools**: Utilize log analysis tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to analyze and visualize file access events.

### 3. Restrict Non-Privileged Processes

*   **SELinux policies**: Configure SELinux policies to restrict non-privileged processes from accessing sensitive files.
*   **`setcap` command**: Use the `setcap` command to restrict the execution of non-privileged processes on sensitive files.
    ```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_SYSAdmin+eip' /bin/cat
```

## Conclusion

This alert analysis report provides an overview of the incident and suggests mitigation strategies for restricting access to sensitive files, monitoring file access, and restricting non-privileged processes. By implementing these measures, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### Recommendations for Further Improvement

*   **Regularly review Falco's filter.json file**: Ensure that the `filter.json` file is up-to-date and includes relevant rules for monitoring file access.
*   **Configure additional alerting thresholds**: Adjust Falco's alerting thresholds to ensure that more critical incidents are detected and responded to promptly.
