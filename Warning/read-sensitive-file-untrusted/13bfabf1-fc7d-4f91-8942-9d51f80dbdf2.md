**Report: Sensitive File Access Alert**

**Summary:**
An alert was triggered by Falco, indicating that a non-trusted process accessed a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`) on the host `k8s-worker-01`. The alert includes details about the process (`cat`), container (`nginx`) and user (`root`) involved in the incident.

**Detailed Analysis:**

*   **Event Details:** The event occurred at 11:00:27.536853249 UTC, with the following event type (`openat`) indicating that a non-trusted program opened `/etc/shadow` for reading.
*   **Process Information:**
    *   `proc.exepath`: `/usr/bin/cat`, which is a trusted system utility, but used in an unexpected way to access a sensitive file.
    *   `proc.cmdline`: `cat /etc/shadow`, showing that the `cat` command was executed with the intention of reading the contents of `/etc/shadow`.
*   **Container Information:**
    *   `container.id`: `bb4916bc9bbd`, indicating the container running on the host.
    *   `container.image.repository` and `container.image.tag` are both set to `docker.io/library/nginx` with a tag of `latest`, suggesting that the container is running the latest version of Nginx.
    *   `k8s.ns.name` and `k8s.pod.name` indicate that the container is part of the `default` namespace and `nginx-bf5d5cf98-74vwj` pod, respectively.

**Mitigation Recommendations:**

1.  **Access Control:**
    *   Ensure that only trusted processes have access to sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`. This can be achieved by implementing strict file permissions and using appropriate access control lists (ACLs) for the `/etc/shadow` file.
2.  **Container Monitoring:**
    *   Regularly monitor container logs and output for suspicious activity, such as accessing sensitive files. Falco's alert system can help identify such incidents early on.
3.  **Configuration Hardening:**
    *   Review and adjust configuration files to prevent unexpected access to sensitive data. This includes ensuring that unnecessary commands are not executed and that proper input validation is performed.

**Falco Configuration Adjustments:**

To mitigate the behavior seen in this alert, consider implementing the following Falco configuration adjustments:

*   **Block suspicious containers:** Add a rule to block containers running with the `nginx` image:
    ```yml
rule_name: Block Nginx Containers

match:
  - container.image.repository == "docker.io/library/nginx"
  - container.name == "nginx"

log:
  level: info
  output:
    - falco-logger
```
*   **Restrict file access:** Modify the existing rule to restrict access to sensitive files:
    ```yml
rule_name: Restrict Sensitive File Access

match:
  - fd.name in ["/etc/shadow", "/etc/passwd"]

log:
  level: info
  output:
    - falco-logger
```
*   **Additional alerting rules:** Implement additional alerting rules to detect similar incidents and receive notifications early on:

```yml
rule_name: Sensitive File Access

match:
  - process.name in ["cat", "grep"]
  - fd.name in ["/etc/shadow", "/etc/passwd"]

log:
  level: warning
  output:
    - falco-logger
```
By implementing these Falco configuration adjustments, you can help prevent sensitive file access and detect potential security incidents earlier on.
