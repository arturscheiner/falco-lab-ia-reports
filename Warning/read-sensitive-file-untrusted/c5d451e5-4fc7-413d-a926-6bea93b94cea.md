**Alert Analysis Report**
==========================

**Summary**

The attached Falco alert indicates that a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`) has been opened for reading by a non-trusted program (`containerd-shim`). This alert is triggered by the `Read sensitive file untrusted` rule and has a priority of `Warning`.

**Details**

*   The alert occurred on `k8s-worker-01` at 21:35:01.281205712 UTC.
*   The event type is `openat`, indicating that the file descriptor was opened.
*   The non-trusted program is `containerd-shim`, which is running in the container `ping-pod`.
*   The file being accessed is `/etc/shadow`, which contains sensitive information about system users and their passwords.

**Mitigation Strategies**

### 1. Configure Docker to restrict privileged containers

To prevent this issue, you can configure Docker to run containers with restricted privileges. You can achieve this by adding the following line to your `docker-compose.yml` file or equivalent configuration:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
    ...
    containerd_shim:
        securityopts:
            - no-new-privs=true
```

This setting will limit the capabilities of the `containerd-shim` process, preventing it from accessing sensitive files.

### 2. Use a Docker image with restricted capabilities

You can also use a Docker image that is already configured to restrict privileges. For example, you can use the official `busybox:latest` image and configure it to run as a non-root user:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --securityopt no-new-privs=true busybox:latest /bin/sh
```

This will limit the capabilities of the `busybox` process, preventing it from accessing sensitive files.

### 3. Implement additional security measures

To further improve security, you can implement additional measures such as:

*   Using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes to manage and restrict containers.
*   Configuring network policies to limit communication between containers and external systems.
*   Regularly reviewing and updating your container images to ensure they are up-to-date with the latest security patches.

**Example Configuration**

To apply these mitigation strategies, you can add the following configuration to your Falco rules:

```yml
[_rules]
- name: Read sensitive file untrusted
  tags:
    - T1555
    - container
    - filesystem
    - host
    - maturity_stable
    - mitre_credential_access
  matchers:
    - type: process
      name: containerd-shim
    - type: process
      name: cat
    - type: file
      path: /etc/shadow
```

This configuration will trigger the `Read sensitive file untrusted` rule when a non-trusted program (either `containerd-shim` or `cat`) attempts to access the `/etc/shadow` file.
