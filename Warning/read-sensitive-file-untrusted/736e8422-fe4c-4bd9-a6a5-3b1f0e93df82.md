**Alert Analysis Report**

**Summary**

The attached Falco alert indicates that a non-trusted program (identified as `cat`) has opened a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`) for reading. The alert is triggered by the `Read sensitive file untrusted` rule.

**Event Details**

* **Event UUID**: `736e8422-fe4c-4bd9-a6a5-3b1f0e93df82`
* **Output**:
```
11:01:08.953513046: Warning Sensitive file opened for reading by non-trusted program (file=/etc/shadow gparent=containerd-shim ggparent=systemd gggparent=<NA> evt_type=openat user=root user_uid=0 user_loginuid=-1 process=cat proc_exepath=/usr/bin/cat parent=runc command=cat /etc/shadow terminal=34816 container_id=bb4916bc9bbd container_name=<NA>)
```
* **Priority**: `Warning`

**Rule Information**

The alert is triggered by the `Read sensitive file untrusted` rule, which is part of the Falco configuration.

**Mitigation Strategies**

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following:

1. **Configure access controls**: Ensure that only trusted processes can read sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`. This can be achieved by configuring SELinux or AppArmor policies to restrict file access.
2. **Implement alternative commands**: Consider using alternative commands (e.g., `getent` instead of `cat`) that do not require reading sensitive files.
3. **Use secure file permissions**: Ensure that sensitive files have restrictive permissions (e.g., `-rwx--r-x` for owner, group, and others respectively) to limit access.
4. **Configure Falco rules**: Modify the `Read sensitive file untrusted` rule in Falco configuration to include a more specific `process` or `user` condition to reduce false positives.

**Falco Configuration Changes**

To modify the `Read sensitive file untrusted` rule, add the following configuration:
```yaml
rules:
  - name: Read sensitive file untrusted
    match:
      process:
        - 'cat'
      user:
        - root
      files:
        - /etc/shadow
    action:
      - log
```
This updated rule will only trigger for processes named `cat` running as the `root` user and accessing `/etc/shadow`.

**Additional Recommendations**

* Monitor system logs to identify potential security incidents.
* Regularly review Falco configuration rules to ensure they align with organizational security policies.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as monitoring and logging sensitive file access.

By implementing these mitigation strategies and configuring Falco rules accordingly, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive files on your hosts.
