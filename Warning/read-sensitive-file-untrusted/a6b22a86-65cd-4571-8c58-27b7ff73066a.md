**Incident Report**

**Event Details**

The attached content provides details about an alert generated by Falco, a system for monitoring and analyzing log data. The event is categorized under the rule "Read sensitive file untrusted" with a priority of Warning.

**Summary of Event**

* **Container ID**: 711236931bc7
* **Image Repository**: docker.io/library/busybox
* **Image Tag**: latest
* **Event Type**: openat
* **File Descriptor**: /etc/shadow
* **User Information**:
	+ User Name: root
	+ User UID: 0
	+ User Login UID: -1
* **Process Information**:
	+ Process Name: cat
	+ Process Path: /bin/cat

The event indicates that the process "cat" has opened the sensitive file "/etc/shadow" in a container with ID 711236931bc7, which belongs to the image repository docker.io/library/busybox. The file descriptor and user information suggest that the process is running with elevated privileges.

**Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Configure SELinux**: Ensure that SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is configured to restrict access to sensitive files like /etc/shadow. This can be done by creating a policy module or using an existing one.
2. **Implement File Permissions**: Set the file permissions of /etc/shadow to restrict read access to non-root users. Use the `chmod` command with the 0440 permission mode (read-only for owner and group, but readable by nobody).
```bash
chmod 0440 /etc/shadow
```
3. **Use Alternative Tools**: Instead of using the "cat" command to view system logs, use alternative tools like `journalctl` or `syslog-ng`.
4. **Monitor Container Activity**: Continuously monitor container activity and enforce strict security policies to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Configure Falco Rules**: Configure Falco rules to detect similar events in the future. This can be done by creating a new rule file or modifying an existing one.

**Example Configuration**

To mitigate this issue, you can add the following configuration to your Falco rules:
```yml
rules:
  - name: "Read sensitive file untrusted"
    trigger:
      container.id: ['^711236931bc7$']
      image.repository: ['docker.io/library/busybox']
      file_descriptor: ["/etc/shadow"]
      process.name: ["cat"]
    action:
      notify:
        - alert.system.sensitive_file_opened
```
This configuration triggers an alert when the container with ID 711236931bc7 and image repository docker.io/library/busybox opens the sensitive file /etc/shadow using the "cat" process.

Note: These configurations assume that you have already installed and configured Falco, SELinux, and other relevant tools. Adjustments may be necessary based on your specific environment and requirements.
