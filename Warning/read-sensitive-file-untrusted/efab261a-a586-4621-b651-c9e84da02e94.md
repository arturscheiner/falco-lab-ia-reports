**Incident Report: Sensitive File Access by Non-Trusted Program**

**Summary**

A security incident was detected on the host `k8s-worker-01` where a non-trusted program accessed a sensitive file `/etc/shadow` using the `cat` command. This is a potential indicators of privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Details**

The Falco alert indicates that:

*   The event occurred at 17:42:21.191256397 UTC on October 29, 2024.
*   A non-trusted program (user root with UID 0) accessed the sensitive file `/etc/shadow`.
*   The `cat` command was used to access the file.
*   The `containerd-shim` process was running in the background.

**Potential Impact**

The potential impact of this incident is that a malicious actor may have gained access to sensitive information stored in the `/etc/shadow` file, which could include hashed passwords for system users.

**Mitigation Steps**

To mitigate this behavior, consider applying the following configuration:

### Falco Rule Configuration

1.  Update the existing Falco rule `Read sensitive file untrusted` to:
    ```yaml
rule: Read sensitive file untrusted
when: 'syscall.openat(file=/etc/shadow) and not (container.id=<NA>)'
priority: Warning
```
    This rule will only trigger for events where the non-trusted program attempts to access `/etc/shadow` using `openat`, but does not belong to a container.

2.  Create a new Falco rule to block access to sensitive files:
    ```yaml
rule: Block access to sensitive files
when: 'syscall.openat(file=/etc/shadow or /etc/passwd or /etc/group) and (user.name != "root" or user.uid != 0)'
priority: Error
```
    This rule will trigger for any event where the non-trusted program attempts to access `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd`, or `/etc/group` without being root or having a valid UID.

### Linux Configuration

1.  Update the default permissions for `/etc/shadow` to prevent unauthorized access:
    ```bash
sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
```
2.  Set up a logging mechanism, such as Syslog or Auditd, to track sensitive file accesses and alert administrators:

### Containerization Configuration (if applicable)

1.  Review the container's configuration to ensure it is properly isolated from the host:
    ```bash
sudo cat /etc/containerd/config.toml | grep "Capabilities"
```
2.  Update any relevant container configurations to limit access to sensitive files.

**Next Steps**

Monitor the system for similar incidents and review logs for further insight into potential vulnerabilities. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as:

*   Implementing a Least Privilege principle for containerized applications
*   Using Linux capabilities or seccomp filters to restrict file access
*   Regularly reviewing and updating system configurations

**Conclusion**

This incident highlights the importance of monitoring sensitive file accesses and ensuring proper privilege management. By implementing the recommended configuration changes, you can mitigate potential vulnerabilities and maintain a more secure environment for your hosts.
