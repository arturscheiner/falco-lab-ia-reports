**Alert Analysis Report**

**Summary:**

The attached Falco alert indicates that a non-trusted program has opened the `/etc/shadow` file for reading. This is considered sensitive, as it contains potentially sensitive information.

**Breakdown of the Alert:**

*   **UUID:** `74eff4e1-1417-4b3d-9e37-6007549ec241`
*   **Output:** The alert provides detailed information about the event, including:
    *   File path: `/etc/shadow`
    *   Process details:
        +   Command: `cat /etc/shadow` (non-trusted program)
        +   Parent process: `containerd-shim` (trusty)
        +   Executable path: `/bin/cat`
    *   User information:
        +   User ID: 0
        +   Login UID: -1
        +   User name: root

**Mitigation Strategies:**

### Rule Configuration:

To mitigate this issue, consider configuring the Falco rule to require trusted processes to access sensitive files. You can modify the existing rule or create a new one using the `read_sensitive_file_untrusted` rule.

Example configuration:

```yml
rules:
- name: read_sensitive_file_untrusted
  pattern: {
    "syscall": [
      {
        "evt_type": ["openat"],
        "fd.name": ["/etc/shadow", "/etc/passwd", "/etc/group"],
        "proc.aname[3]": ["containerd-shim", "systemd"]
      }
    ]
  },
  actions:
    - alert: Read sensitive file untrusted
      level: Warning
```

### Falco Configuration:

You can also modify the Falco configuration to add a custom rule. For example, you can add the following configuration to the `falco.yaml` file:

```yml
rules:
- name: read_sensitive_file_untrusted
  pattern:
    "syscall": [
      {
        "evt_type": ["openat"],
        "fd.name": ["/etc/shadow", "/etc/passwd", "/etc/group"],
        "proc.aname[3]": ["containerd-shim", "systemd"]
      }
    ]
```

### Container Configuration:

To prevent sensitive files from being accessed by non-trusted processes, you can configure the container to use a chrooted environment or mount sensitive files with restricted permissions.

For example, you can modify the Docker configuration file (`docker-compose.yml`) to include the following settings:

```yml
version: '3'

services:
  worker:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /etc/shadow:/etc/shadow
      - /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd
      - /etc/group:/etc/group
```

By mounting sensitive files with restricted permissions, you can limit the access of non-trusted processes.

### Monitoring and Logging:

To further monitor and log these events, consider using a logging agent like `syslog` or `fluentd`. These tools allow you to collect and analyze log data from various sources, including Falco alerts.

Example configuration:

```yml
logging:
  - name: fluentd
    type: syslog
    host: fluentd-host
```

By implementing these mitigation strategies and configuring Falco accordingly, you can reduce the risk of sensitive files being accessed by non-trusted processes.
