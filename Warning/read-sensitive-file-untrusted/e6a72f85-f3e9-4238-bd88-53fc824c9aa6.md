**Incident Report**
====================

**Summary:**
A potential security incident was detected on the host `k8s-worker-02` where a non-trusted program, identified as `cat`, accessed a sensitive file located at `/etc/shadow`.

**Details:**

The Falco alert indicates that the `cat` process opened the `/etc/shadow` file for reading. The `/etc/shadow` file contains sensitive user information and should only be accessible by authorized users.

**Analysis:**

* The `cat` process is not a trusted application, as it is not part of the expected process list.
* The `cat` process is attempting to read from the `/etc/shadow` file, which is a sensitive file that should only be accessed by authorized users.
* The `containerd-shim` process, which is responsible for running the `cat` process, has a valid container ID (`23c28095aa6b`) and image information (`docker.io/library/busybox`).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
-------------------------

### 1. Review Container Configuration

To prevent similar incidents in the future, review the container configuration to ensure that only authorized processes have access to sensitive files.

* Check the `docker-compose.yml` file or other container configuration files for any references to sensitive files.
* Ensure that only trusted containers are running and that their configurations do not expose sensitive files.

Example:
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  ...
  busybox:
    image: docker.io/library/busybox
    volumes:
      - /etc/shadow:/etc/shadow:ro
```
In this example, the `/etc/shadow` file is mounted as a read-only volume to prevent unauthorized access.

### 2. Implement File System Access Controls

Implement file system access controls to restrict access to sensitive files.

* Set the permissions on the `/etc/shadow` file to ensure that only authorized users can read from it.
* Use a file system agent such as SELinux or AppArmor to enforce these permissions and prevent unauthorized access.

Example (using SELinux):
```bash
# Set permissions on /etc/shadow
chmod 400 /etc/shadow

# Enable SELinux
setenforce 1
```
### 3. Monitor File Access

Regularly monitor file access events to detect similar incidents early.

* Use a log aggregation tool such as ELK Stack or Splunk to collect and analyze file access logs.
* Set up alerts for suspicious file access patterns, such as unknown users attempting to read sensitive files.

Example (using ELK Stack):
```yml
# Filebeat configuration
filebeat:
  events enabled: true
  files:
    - /var/log/audit.log
  output.logstash:
    hosts: ['logstash:9200']
```
### 4. Implement Container Monitoring

Implement container monitoring to detect suspicious container behavior.

* Use a container monitoring tool such as Prometheus or Datadog to collect and analyze container performance metrics.
* Set up alerts for suspicious container behavior, such as unexpected file access patterns.

Example (using Prometheus):
```yml
# Prometheus configuration
global:
  scrape_interval: 10s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'container'
    scrape_interval: 10s
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
```
By implementing these mitigation strategies, you can reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future.
