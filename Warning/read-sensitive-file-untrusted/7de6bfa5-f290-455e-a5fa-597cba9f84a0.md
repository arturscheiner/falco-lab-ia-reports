**Alert Analysis Report**
==========================

**Summary**

The attached Falco alert indicates a potential security incident where a non-trusted program accessed a sensitive file `/etc/shadow` on the host `k8s-worker-01`. The incident occurred at 13:56:22.787312466 UTC on October 9, 2024.

**Detailed Analysis**

    *   `user.name`: `root`
    *   `user.uid`: `0`
*   **Container Information`:
    *   `container.id`: `d2d430b34bdd`
    *   `container.name`: `<NA>`
*   **Event Attributes`:

    *   `gparent`: `systemd`
    *   `ggparent`: `<NA>`
    *   `gggparent`: `<NA>`
    *   `terminal`: `34816`

**Mitigation and Configuration**

To mitigate this incident, consider the following:

### 1. File Permissions

*   **Current Permissions**: The `/etc/shadow` file is likely owned by root (`root:root`) with read permissions for everyone (`chmod -R o+r /etc/shadow`).
    *   **Recommended Permissions**: Set the ownership to `root:root` and set the permissions to `chmod 600 /etc/shadow`, limiting access to only the owner.

### 2. File Access Control

*   Implement a File Access Control (FAC) system, such as SELinux or AppArmor, to restrict file access based on user roles.
    *   **Configuration**: Configure the FAC system to deny access to `/etc/shadow` for non-root users.

### 3. Process Monitoring and Whitelisting

*   Monitor processes running with elevated privileges to detect potential security incidents.
    *   **Command**: `ps -eo pid,cmd,%cpu,%mem | grep -f <path/to/whitelist>`
*   Implement a process whitelisting system to only allow approved processes to run.
    *   **Configuration**: Configure the process whitelisting system to exclude `/bin/cat` from allowed processes.

### 4. Containerization and Security

*   Review container images for potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
    *   **Command**: `docker inspect <container_id> | grep -f <path/to/secure_config>`
*   Implement a secure containerization framework, such as Kubernetes, to enforce security policies.

### 5. Alerting and Notification

*   Configure Falco to send notifications to the incident response team when sensitive events are detected.
    *   **Configuration**: Update the Falco configuration file (`falco.conf`) to include notification settings for sensitive events.

Example `falco.conf` configuration:
```yml
[rule]
name: Read sensitive file untrusted
match:
  - syscalls.openat
  - files[/etc/shadow]
  - processes(["cat", "/bin/cat"])
on:
  - critical
  - severity: warning
  - trigger: high
  notification:
    - name: Alert
      type: email
      recipients:
        - <incident_response_email>
```

### 6. Log Analysis and Review

*   Regularly review logs to detect potential security incidents or anomalies.
    *   **Command**: `grep -f <path/to/log_pattern> /var/log/falco.log`
*   Implement a log analysis tool, such as ELK Stack, to help detect and respond to security incidents.

By implementing these measures, you can mitigate the incident described in the alert attachment and reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future.
