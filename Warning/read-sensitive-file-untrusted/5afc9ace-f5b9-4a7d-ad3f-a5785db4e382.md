# Incident Report
## Incident Details

The attached Falco alert log indicates a potential security incident involving the unauthorized access to sensitive files on the host system. The alert details a specific file, `/etc/shadow`, being opened for reading by a non-trusted program (identified as `cat`) without proper authorization.

### Alert Analysis

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Event Type** | openat |
| **File Path** | /etc/shadow |
| **Process Information** | proc.name = cat, proc.exepath = /bin/cat, proc.pname = containerd-shim |
| **User Information** | user.name = root, user.uid = 0 |

The alert is triggered by the `read sensitive file untrusted` rule. The incident details suggest that a process (`cat`) with an elevated privilege level (uid=0) is attempting to read a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`). This could potentially allow for unauthorized access to system-wide information.

### Possible Explanation

This incident might be related to:

*   An authorized user mistakenly running the `cat` command on the `/etc/shadow` file.
*   A malicious actor exploiting the privilege escalation vulnerability in the containerd-shim process.
*   An unintended configuration error allowing unauthorized processes to access sensitive files.

### Recommendations for Mitigation

#### Configuration Adjustments

To prevent similar incidents, consider implementing the following Falco configurations:

```markdown
# Deny file access by non-trusted programs
deny [cat] read /etc/shadow

# Restrict cat command to trusted users only
allow [user=root] run [cat]
```

Additionally, you can configure Falco to monitor and alert on potential privilege escalation events. For example:

```markdown
# Deny elevated privileges for containerd-shim process
deny [containerd-shim] elevated_privileges
```

#### Command Line Adjustments

To mitigate this incident, consider the following command line adjustments:

*   Ensure that the `/etc/shadow` file is properly secured and not accessible to unauthorized users. This can be done by changing the ownership of the file or using a more secure alternative.
*   Verify that the `cat` command is being used correctly and only when necessary. Consider using an alternative command (e.g., `grep`) for file inspection purposes.

#### Containerd-shim Configuration

Review the containerd-shim configuration to ensure it's properly secured:

```bash
# Verify containerd configuration
containerd --config /etc/containerd/config.toml --runtime rkt --log-level debug
```

### Next Steps

*   Investigate the root cause of this incident to determine if it was an isolated incident or a sign of a larger vulnerability.
*   Implement additional security measures to prevent similar incidents, such as monitoring file access and adjusting Falco configurations accordingly.

This report provides an overview of the incident details, possible explanations, and recommended mitigation strategies. By implementing these adjustments, you can reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future.
