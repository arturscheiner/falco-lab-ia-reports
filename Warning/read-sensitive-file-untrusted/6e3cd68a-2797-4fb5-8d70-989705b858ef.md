**Incident Report**
================

**Summary**
-----------

A sensitive file, `/etc/shadow`, was accessed by a non-trusted program (`cat`) on the host `k8s-worker-01`. The incident occurred at 11:01:08.953513046 UTC.

**Details**
----------

The alert indicates that the containerd-shim and systemd processes opened the `/etc/shadow` file for reading, but their gparent (grandparent) and ggparent (great-grandparent) are not set to trusted values. This suggests that the file was accessed by a non-trusted program through an unintended interface.

**Mitigation Strategies**
-----------------------

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following:

### 1. Configure Filesystem Access

Set the `fs.inotify.use_inuman` and `fs.inotify.prune` sysctl settings to prevent untrusted programs from accessing sensitive files.
```bash
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.use_inuman=0
sudo sysctl -w fs.inotify.prune=1
```
### 2. Enhance Container Security

Review the container's security configuration and ensure that:

* The `nginx` container is configured to only allow trusted connections.
* The `runc` process is not allowed to access sensitive files.

Example:
```bash
sudo docker run -d --security-opt seccomp --seccomp-profile=/etc/seccomp/profiles/default.json nginx:latest
```
### 3. Monitor File Access

Implement a monitoring system that detects and alerts on suspicious file access patterns, such as the opening of `/etc/shadow` by non-trusted programs.

**Recommendations**
------------------

1. Review and update the `seccomp` profile for the `nginx` container to restrict file access.
2. Configure the `fs.inotify` sysctl settings to prevent untrusted programs from accessing sensitive files.
3. Implement a monitoring system to detect suspicious file access patterns.

By implementing these measures, you can reduce the risk of future incidents and improve overall security posture.

**Additional Notes**
-------------------

* Consult with your organization's security team to determine the best course of action for this incident.
* Review the `docker` logs and container runtime output to identify any potential issues or vulnerabilities.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as SELinux or AppArmor, to further restrict file access and system resources.
