**Incident Report: Sensitive File Read by Non-Trusted Program**
===========================================================

**Summary**

A Falco alert has been generated indicating that a non-trusted program (process `cat`) has opened a sensitive file (`/etc/shadow`) for reading. The file is owned by the root user with UID 0, which suggests it contains administrative credentials.

**Details**

The alert details are as follows:

*   **Event**: Openat event detected on `/etc/shadow` with process `cat` and parent process `containerd-shim`.
*   **Process Information**:
    *   Process name: cat
    *   Process path: /bin/cat
    *   Parent process: containerd-shim
*   **Container Information**:
    *   Container ID: d2d430b34bdd
    *   Image repository: docker.io/library/busybox
    *   Image tag: latest
    *   Name: ping-pod
*   **User Information**:
    *   User name: root
    *   Login UID: -1 (root login)

**Mitigation and Recommendations**

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following steps:

### 1. File Permissions

Review and adjust file permissions to restrict access to sensitive files.

```bash
sudo chgrp -R system /etc/shadow
sudo chmod u-g o-x /etc/shadow
```

Apply similar changes for other sensitive files as required by your organization's security policies.

### 2. Process Monitoring and Restriction

Implement additional monitoring and restriction on the `cat` process:

```bash
# Falco configuration (filter)
fall:cat {
    rules:
      - type: process_openat
        fields:
          process.name: cat
          fd.name: /etc/shadow
      - type: process_restrict
        fields:
          process.name: cat
          container.id: d2d430b34bdd
```

This configuration will restrict the `cat` process from opening sensitive files.

### 3. Containerization and Network Security

Review your containerization setup to ensure proper network isolation and segmentation:

*   Verify that containers are properly configured with restrictive network policies.
*   Ensure that sensitive data is not exposed to untrusted containers or processes.

**Example Configuration: Docker Network**

Create a new network configuration for the `ping-pod` container:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile (example)
FROM busybox:latest

# Create a new network configuration
RUN mkdir -p /etc/docker networking
COPY networking.json /etc/docker/networking/
```

Create the `networking.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "default",
  "scope": "local",
  "driver": "bridge",
  "ipam": {
    "config": [
      {
        "from": "192.168.0.100/24"
      }
    ]
  },
  "endpoints": []
}
```

Apply this configuration to ensure proper network isolation and segmentation.

### 4. Regular Auditing and Monitoring

Schedule regular auditing and monitoring to detect similar incidents:

*   Implement a security information and event management (SIEM) system to collect and analyze logs from your hosts.
*   Schedule regular scans of sensitive files for unauthorized access or modifications.

By implementing these measures, you can help prevent similar incidents in the future and maintain the integrity of your sensitive data.
