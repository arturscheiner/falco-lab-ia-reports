**Incident Report: PTRACE Attached to Process Alert**

**Summary:**
A potential privilege escalation incident was detected via the Falco alert system, indicating a PTRACE_ATTACH attempt on a process. The incident occurred on the host `mini-debian-lab` at timestamp 2024-10-07T20:24:32.084474822Z.

**Detailed Analysis:**

*   **Event Type:** ptrace
*   **Event Details:**
    *   Process name: strace
    *   Command line: htop
    *   Parent process: htop
    *   User credentials: root (UID 0), login UID -1
    *   TTY number: 34819
*   **Container Information:**
    *   Container ID: host
    *   Container Name: host

**Mitigation Strategies:**

### Command Line Configuration

To mitigate this incident, you can configure Falco to alert on PTRACE_ATTACH attempts with specific conditions. For example:

```yml
rules:
  - name: restrict-ptrace-access
    matchers:
      - selector:
          evt.type: ptrace
        conditions:
          - not (user.name == root)
      - selector:
          proc.pname: htop
        actions:
          - alert
```

This rule will alert on PTRACE_ATTACH attempts made by the `root` user, but will ignore similar incidents made by other users.

### Configuration of Falco

Additionally, you can configure Falco to only collect and process logs from trusted sources. You can do this by adding a `source` selector:

```yml
rules:
  - name: restrict-source-logging
    matchers:
      - selector:
          source: "syscall"
        conditions:
          - not (user.name == root)
```

This rule will ensure that only system calls from non-root users are collected and processed by Falco.

### Container Isolation

To further mitigate the incident, you can consider isolating containers to prevent unauthorized access. You can use container isolation features like Linux's `ns-notify` or Windows' `secdirectory` to restrict communication between containers.

```bash
# Linux example
lsns -f /proc/119518/ns/pid -t 0x40000000 > /etc/sysctl.d/ptrace_restrict.conf

# Apply the new configuration
sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/ptrace_restrict.conf
```

### User Access Control

You can also implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user privileges. For example, you can use Linux's `setcap` command to limit the capabilities of non-root users:

```bash
# Limit the ptrace capability for non-root users
setcap CAP_PTRACE=ep /usr/bin/strace
```

This will prevent non-root users from using the `ptrace` system call.

### Conclusion

The alert indicates a potential privilege escalation incident caused by a PTRACE_ATTACH attempt on a process. By configuring Falco to restrict access based on user credentials and container information, you can mitigate the risk of future incidents. Implementing additional measures like container isolation and user access control can further reduce the attack surface.
