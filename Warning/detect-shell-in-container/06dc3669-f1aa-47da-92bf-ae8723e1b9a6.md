**Alert Report: Shell Execution in Container**

**Summary:**
An alert has been triggered by Falco, indicating that a shell command (`sh -c ip link del calico_tmp_A || true`) was executed within a container (ID: `64fac540e48f`) on host `k8s-master-01`. This behavior is flagged as a potential security risk.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Container Hardening:**
	* Review and restrict container privileges using SELinux or AppArmor to prevent unnecessary privileges from being granted.
	* Ensure that containers only run with the necessary permissions for their intended functionality.
2. **Shell Script Validation:**
	* Verify that shell scripts executed within containers are validated and sanitized to prevent code injection attacks.
	* Use tools like `shellcheck` or `clang-analyzer` to detect potential security vulnerabilities in shell scripts.
3. **Container Network Configuration:**
	* Review and restrict container network configurations to prevent unauthorized access to the host network.
	* Ensure that Calico (or other networking solutions) is properly configured and monitored to detect suspicious activity.

**Command Line Configuration:**

To mitigate this behavior, you can apply the following command line configurations:

1. **SELinux Configuration:**
```bash
# Set container permissions to restricted
setenforce 0

# Configure SELinux policies for containers
semodule -a -n "container" -t "container" /etc/selinux/containers.te
```
2. **Shell Script Sanitization:**
```bash
# Install shellcheck tool
sudo apt-get install shellcheck

# Run shellcheck on the suspicious script
shellcheck -f sh script.sh
```
3. **Calico Configuration:**
```bash
# Configure Calico to monitor container network activity
calicoctl create node k8s-master-01 --ip=192.168.1.100 --calico-opts='policy="cni-v2 calico"'

# Create a new policy for suspicious container behavior
calicoctl create policy "shell-in-container" --rule="container:shell"

# Assign the policy to the suspect container
calicoctl create node 64fac540e48f --calico-opts='policy="shell-in-container"'
```
**Recommendations:**

* Regularly review and update Falco configurations to ensure they are aligned with changing security requirements.
* Implement additional monitoring tools, such as Logstash or Fluentd, to gather more detailed information about container activity and network traffic.
* Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in container configurations and shell scripts.
