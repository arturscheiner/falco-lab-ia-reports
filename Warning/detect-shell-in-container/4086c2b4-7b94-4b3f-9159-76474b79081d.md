**Alert Analysis Report**

**Event Details**

The attached alert contains information about a suspicious activity detected on the host `k8s-master-01`. The key details are as follows:

* **UUID**: `4086c2b4-7b94-4b3f-9159-76474b79081d`
* **Priority**: `Warning`
* **Rule Name**: `Detect Shell in Container`
* **Time**: `2024-10-29T13:40:44.375924178Z`

**Event Summary**

The alert indicates that a shell execution was detected within a container on the host `k8s-master-01`. The specific details are:

* **Container ID**: `185304d1bba4`
* **Process Commandline**: `/docker-entrypoint.sh auto` (bash)
* **Process Name**: `bash`
* **User Name**: `root`

**Possible Causes**

The exact cause of this alert is unclear without more context. However, it's possible that the container execution of `/docker-entrypoint.sh auto` is attempting to run a shell script, which could be malicious if not intended.

**Mitigation Strategies**

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following steps:

### 1. Review and Update Docker Configuration

*   Inspect the `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-entrypoint.sh` files to ensure they are not executing malicious commands.
*   Consider updating the `/docker-entrypoint.sh` file to prevent shell execution.

```bash
# Before
/bin/sh -c "/path/to/malicious/command"

# After
/bin/sh -c "/path/to/legitimate/command"
```

### 2. Configure SELinux (Optional)

If your system is configured with SELinux, you can adjust the SELinux policy to allow or disallow shell execution within containers.

```bash
# Enable auditing for selinux
setenforce 0

# Allow or deny specific contexts
auditctl -M example > /etc/audit/audit.rules

# Example rule to allow bash execution
-a exit, exit
-s:container:shell_exec
-c:container_name
```

### 3. Monitor Container Logs and Activity

*   Regularly monitor container logs for suspicious activity.
*   Consider implementing logging and monitoring tools like Falco or ELK.

```bash
# Example Falco configuration
[DetectShellInContainer]
rules:
- alert: Shell executed in a container
  conditions:
    - type:container_id
      key:container.id
      value: 185304d1bba4
    - type:process
      key:proc.cmdline
      value: /docker-entrypoint.sh auto
    - type:user
      key:user.name
      value: root

```

### 4. Restrict User Privileges

*   Ensure the user running the container has limited privileges.
*   Consider using a different user account or group for container execution.

```bash
# Example useradd command
useradd -s /bin/false testuser
```

### 5. Implement Network Segmentation (Optional)

If the suspicious activity is related to network communication, consider implementing network segmentation to isolate affected containers.

```bash
# Example Docker network configuration
network:
  driver: bridge
  driveropts: ["parent=true"]
  endpoint_id: "my-network"
```

By implementing these mitigation strategies, you can reduce the risk of malicious shell execution within your containers.
