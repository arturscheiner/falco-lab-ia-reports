*   **hostname**: The hostname of the host on which the alert was triggered is "k8s-master-01".

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the behavior seen in this alert, consider the following command-line or configuration changes:

1.  **Restrict Root Privileges**

    *   Review and adjust permissions for the `root` user to ensure they only have necessary access to perform their duties.
    *   Use a more secure alternative to `sudo`, such as `su -` or `sudo -i`.

        ```bash
# Using su -
user root
su -

# Or, using sudo with a non-root user
sudo -u <non_root_user> <command>
```

2.  **Container and Process Monitoring**

    *   Install additional monitoring tools to track container and process activity on the host.
    *   Use Falco or other logging solutions to monitor system logs for suspicious activity.

        ```bash
# Enable monitoring of container and process activity with Falco
[alert "Shell in Container"]
  tags: [container, process, shell]
  file: /var/log/falco.log
```

3.  **Docker Configuration**

    *   Review Docker configuration to ensure that `root` privileges are not assigned to containers or processes.
    *   Use a more secure alternative to `/docker-entrypoint.sh`, such as a custom script or an image with restricted permissions.

        ```bash
# Disable privileged mode in the Docker container
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN set --privileged=false

# Create a custom entry point script for your application
CMD ["./app.sh"]
```

4.  **System Updates and Patches**

    *   Regularly update and patch the host system to ensure it has the latest security patches.
    *   Use a reputable package manager, such as `apt` or `yum`, to keep the system up-to-date.

        ```bash
# Update and upgrade the package list on an Ubuntu-based system
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

# Perform similar actions on a Red Hat-based system with yum
sudo yum update && sudo yum full-update
```

By implementing these strategies, you can reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities and improve the overall security posture of your host.
