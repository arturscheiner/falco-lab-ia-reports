**Alert Analysis Report**
==========================

**Summary**

The attached Falco alert indicates that a shell (`bash`) has been executed in a container with the user `root` on the host `k8s-master-01`. The event occurred at `2024-10-29T13:40:44.374449001Z`.

**Details**

* **Container Information**
	+ Container ID: `185304d1bba4`
	+ Process Name: `bash`
	+ Command Line: `/docker-entrypoint.sh auto`
* **User Information**
	+ User Name: `root`

**Potential Security Implications**

The execution of a shell in a container with elevated privileges (user `root`) could be indicative of malicious activity, such as:

* Unauthorized access to the container
* Escalation of privileges within the container
* Potential use of the container for lateral movement or pivot attacks

**Mitigation Strategies**
------------------------

To mitigate this behavior, consider applying the following measures:

### 1. Container Configuration

* Ensure that the container's entrypoint script (`/docker-entrypoint.sh`) is not executing a shell with elevated privileges.
* Verify that the container's security context is set to `Privileged=false` or equivalent.

Example:
```yaml
{
  "name": "my-container",
  "image": "my-image",
  "securityContext": {
    "privileged": false,
    "capabilities": {
      "add": [
        "CAP_SYS_ADMIN"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Systemd Units

* Create a systemd unit file to restrict the execution of the `/docker-entrypoint.sh` script.
* Use `ExecStartPost` to execute a script that checks for unauthorized shell execution.

Example:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Restricted Docker Entrypoint
After=docker.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh auto
ExecStartPost=/usr/local/bin/check-shell-execution.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" != "auto" ]; then
  echo "Error: Shell execution not authorized"
  exit 1
fi
```
### 3. Falco Configuration

* Update the Falco configuration to log alerts for shell execution in containers.
* Consider adding additional tags or fields to enhance alert visibility.

Example:
```yaml
rules:
- name: detect_shell_execution
  source: syscall
  condition:
    field: proc.name == "bash"
    field: user.name == "root"
    field: container.id != "default"
  output: |
    {{ event | json }}
```

### 4. Monitoring and Detection

* Continuously monitor the system for suspicious activity.
* Consider implementing additional detection tools or monitoring solutions to enhance security posture.

By applying these measures, you can help mitigate the potential security implications of shell execution in containers with elevated privileges.

**Recommendations**

1. Review and update container configurations to ensure proper security settings.
2. Implement restricted systemd unit files to limit script execution.
3. Update Falco configuration to log alerts for shell execution in containers.
4. Continuously monitor the system for suspicious activity using additional detection tools or monitoring solutions.

By taking these steps, you can enhance the overall security posture of your containerized environment and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or malicious activity.
