# Incident Report: Privileged Activity Detected on Host
==============================================

### Summary

An alert has been triggered by Falco, indicating a potential security incident on the host `mini-debian-lab`. The alert is related to privileged activity detected in the `/tmp` directory.

### Alert Details

The attached alert log provides the following information:

*   **Event ID**: `2255120a-3142-4069-b524-c1a27a509098`
*   **Priority**: `Warning`
*   **Rule**: "Search Private Keys or Passwords"
*   **Time**: `2024-10-05T13:00:56.905228441Z`

### Alert Analysis

The alert indicates that the process `find` with the command `find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -iname id_rsa` was executed as root user (`user.name=root`, `user.uid=0`) on the host `mini-debian-lab`. The `EXE_WRITABLE|EXE_LOWER_LAYER` flag suggests that the process has execute permissions and is running in a lower layer. This behavior could potentially be used to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.

### Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following measures:

1.  **Deny `/tmp` Access**:
    *   `sudo apt-get install tmpfs-docker` (for Docker)
    *   Create a file system with restrictive permissions: `mkdir /tmp; chown root:root /tmp; chmod 700 /tmp`
2.  **Monitor and Log Privileged Activity**:
    *   Configure Falco to log all privileged activities: Add the following rules to your Falco configuration file (`falco.yaml`): ```yml
    rules:
      - rule: Search Private Keys or Passwords
        source: syscall
        tags:
          - T1552.001
          - container
          - filesystem
          - host
          - maturity_stable
          - mitre_credential_access
          - process
        matchers:
          - type: execve
            exe_flags: EXE_WRITABLE|EXE_LOWER_LAYER
    ```
3.  **Implement a Least Privilege Principle**:
    *   Ensure that all system processes and scripts run with the lowest required privileges to minimize potential damage.
4.  **Regularly Review and Audit System Logs**:
    *   Set up a logging mechanism to track system activity, including login attempts, process executions, and file access.
5.  **Limit User Privileges and Access Control**:
    *   Ensure that users have the minimum necessary privileges and restrict their access to sensitive directories and resources.

### Additional Recommendations

*   Regularly update and patch your systems to ensure you have the latest security fixes.
*   Implement a comprehensive incident response plan to handle potential security incidents.
*   Consider implementing additional security measures, such as a web application firewall (WAF) or intrusion detection system (IDS).

By following these steps, you can mitigate the risk associated with privileged activity detected on your host and improve overall system security.
