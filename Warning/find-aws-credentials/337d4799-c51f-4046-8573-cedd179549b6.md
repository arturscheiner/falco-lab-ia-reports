**Alert Report**
===============

**Summary**

A warning alert was generated on October 5, 2024, at 13:00:59.911641035 Z due to suspicious activity related to AWS credentials search on the host `mini-debian-lab`. The alert is triggered by a process named "find" that searched for files with the name `.aws/credentials` in the `/tmp` directory.

**Detailed Analysis**

The attached JSON attachment provides the following details:

*   **Process Details**: The process "find" was executed with the command `find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -iname .aws/credentials`. This suggests that the process was searching for files with a specific name in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **User and Group Information**: The process was run by user `root` with a login UID of `-1`, indicating that the user is not logged in. The group ID of `0` indicates that the process was running as the root user.
*   **Event Details**: The event type is `execve`, which means the process executed a new executable file. The flags `EXE_WRITABLE|EXE_LOWER_LAYER` suggest that the process has write permissions and is likely modifying the system.

**Mitigation Strategies**
-------------------------

To mitigate this behavior, consider implementing the following:

### 1. Monitor for suspicious commands

Create a custom rule in Falco to monitor for any command that searches for AWS credentials files (e.g., `.aws/credentials`, `~/.aws/credentials`) using regular expressions or string matching.

Example Falco configuration:
```yml
- rule: SuspiciousAWSCommand
  match:
    command: find|grep|aws|ec2|s3|iam
    filter:
      args:
        - /tmp -maxdepth 1 -iname .aws/credentials
```
This rule will trigger an alert if any process executes a command that contains these keywords.

### 2. Restrict root user's permissions

Update the system configuration to restrict the `root` user's permissions, ensuring they can only execute necessary commands.

Example: Add the following line to `/etc/sudoers`:
```bash
# Prevents the find command from being executed by the root user
sudo   ALL = NOPASSWD: !find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -iname .aws/credentials
```
### 3. Use alternative storage for AWS credentials

Consider moving AWS credentials to a secure location, such as an encrypted file or environment variable, instead of searching for them in the `/tmp` directory.

Example:
```bash
# Set AWS credentials as an environment variable
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key'
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_key'
```
### 4. Regularly review system logs

Schedule regular log reviews to identify any suspicious activity and take corrective action.

By implementing these strategies, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your system and protect sensitive information.

**Conclusion**

The attached JSON attachment indicates a potential security threat related to AWS credentials search on the host `mini-debian-lab`. By monitoring for suspicious commands, restricting root user permissions, using alternative storage for AWS credentials, and regularly reviewing system logs, you can mitigate this behavior and ensure your system remains secure.
