**Alert Report**
================

**Summary**
-----------

The attached Falco alert indicates a potential security vulnerability on the host `mini-debian-lab`. The alert was triggered by a directory traversal attack, where an attacker attempted to read sensitive files via a maliciously crafted file path.

**Details**
------------

* **Event Details**: The alert reports an event with the following details:
	+ `evt_type`: openat
	+ `fd.name`: `/etc/shadow`
	+ `fd.nameraw`: `/etc/../etc/etc/shadow` (directory traversal attack)
	+ `proc.cmdline`: `event-generator run syscall --loop`
	+ `proc.exepath`: `/bin/event-generator`
	+ `user.name`: `root`
	+ `user.uid`: 0
* **Source**: The alert originates from the `syscall` source, which suggests that the attack was triggered by a system call.

**Risk Assessment**
-------------------

This event indicates a potential security vulnerability on the host. Directory traversal attacks can be used to access sensitive files and directories, potentially leading to privilege escalation or other security breaches.

**Mitigation Strategies**
-------------------------

To mitigate this behavior, consider the following command line and configuration adjustments:

### 1. Block suspicious file paths

Update Falco's `rules` configuration to block suspicious file paths:
```yml
- rule: Block directory traversal attacks
  pattern:
    - fd.nameraw: /etc\/\*

    - proc.cmdline: event-generator run syscall --loop
```
This will prevent the `/etc/shadow` file from being accessed via a maliciously crafted file path.

### 2. Configure SELinux or AppArmor

If your host is running SELinux or AppArmor, configure these security frameworks to restrict access to sensitive files and directories:
```bash
# SELinux configuration
setenforce 1
sudo semanage fcntl -a -t file_type_t -m add all
```
### 3. Implement robust file system permissions

Ensure that the `/etc/shadow` file has proper file system permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 /etc/shadow`):
```bash
# Set permissions on /etc/shadow
sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow
```

### 4. Monitor for suspicious activity

Regularly monitor Falco alerts and system logs to detect any suspicious activity:
```bash
# Run Falco to alert on suspicious events
falco -f <path/to/rules>
```
**Recommendations**
-------------------

* Regularly review and update Falco's `rules` configuration to ensure it remains effective.
* Implement robust file system permissions and configure SELinux or AppArmor to restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
* Monitor for suspicious activity using Falco and system logs.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, you can reduce the risk of a directory traversal attack on your host.
