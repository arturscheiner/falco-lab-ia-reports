**Incident Report**
=====================

**Summary**
-----------

A sensitive file, `/etc/shadow`, was opened for reading by a trusted program (`httpd`) after the system startup. This incident falls under the category of **T1555: Read Sensitive File Trusted After Startup**.

**Details**
------------

The Falco alert indicates that the `httpd` process has accessed the sensitive file `/etc/shadow` with elevated privileges (user UID 0). This behavior is unusual and potentially indicative of a security vulnerability.

**Observations**
---------------

* The `httpd` process is running under the user ID 0, indicating that it has elevated privileges.
* The file `/etc/shadow` contains sensitive information about user authentication and authorization.
* The `syscall.ReadSensitiveFileUntrusted$` event suggests that the access was unauthorized.

**Mitigation Strategies**
------------------------

### Configuration

1. **Restrict Elevated Privileges**: Ensure that the `httpd` process does not run with elevated privileges. This can be achieved by reviewing the system's configuration and ensuring that the `httpd` service is set to run with a reduced UID.
2. **Monitor File Access**: Implement file access monitoring to detect any unauthorized access to sensitive files in the future.

### Command Line

1. **Review httpd Configuration**: Inspect the `httpd` configuration files to ensure that the process is not accessing sensitive files unnecessarily.
```bash
sudo grep -i /etc/shadow /etc/httpd.conf
```
2. **Verify System Configuration**: Check the system's configuration files to ensure that elevated privileges are properly restricted.
```bash
sudo grep -i uid 0 /etc/passwd
sudo grep -i gid 0 /etc/group
```

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Implement an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Consider deploying an IDS to detect and alert on potential security threats in real-time.
2. **Conduct Regular Security Audits**: Schedule regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
3. **Educate Users**: Provide training and awareness programs for users to ensure that they understand the importance of sensitive file access and the potential consequences of unauthorized access.

**Conclusion**
--------------

This incident highlights the need for vigilance when it comes to sensitive file access in systems with elevated privileges. By implementing the recommended strategies, we can mitigate the risk of future incidents and ensure the security of our systems.

**Recommendations for Falco Configuration**

1. **Add a new rule**: Create a new rule that detects unauthorized access to sensitive files.
```yml
rules:
  - name: Read Sensitive File Trusted After Startup
    match:
      condition:
        nvidia: event_name in ["syscall.ReadSensitiveFileUntrusted$"]
        kernel_version >= "5.10"
      filter:
        process.name != httpd
    tags: [T1555, container, filesystem, host]
```
2. **Update the existing rule**: Enhance the existing rule to include more specific filtering criteria.
```yml
rules:
  - name: Read Sensitive File Trusted After Startup
    match:
      condition:
        nvidia: event_name in ["syscall.ReadSensitiveFileUntrusted$"]
        kernel_version >= "5.10"
      filter:
        process.name == httpd
        file.path =~ "/etc/shadow"
```
By implementing these measures, we can strengthen the Falco alert system and detect potential security threats more effectively.
